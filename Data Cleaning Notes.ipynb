SCALING
Scaling in Data analysis refers to changing numeric values to fit in a range of 0 - 1. Take for e.g. we're dealing with two currencies, ML models cannot necessarily
adjust for equivalency. If we have a column for Naira and a column for USD, given 1USD = 480#, any +1 increase across the two values will be disproportionate.
Hence, we scale them both to fit within a range of 0-1, such that the two columns will be equivalent as well as any increase or decrease made to them

#CODE FOR SCALING
from mlxtend.preprocessing import minmax_scaling

original_data = x
scaled_data = minmax_scaling(original_data, columns=[])

NORMALIZATION
Normalization on the other hand, another tool for organizing data, is the transformation of a data range into a normal distribution. ML models such as Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA),
Gaussian Naive Bayes, etc already assume your data is normally distributed.

#CODE FOR NORMALIZATION using Box-Cox transformation
from scipy import stats
